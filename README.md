# GoogleBooks
A one page application built in Vanilla Java Script that utilises the google books API to display a range of books based on the users search term.
A next and previous button allow the user to navigate the results of the searchers per pages of 30. Additionally, when a user clicks on one of the book cards,
a larger module is displayed providing further information around the selected book.
