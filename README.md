# GoogleBooks
A one page application built in Vanilla Java Script that utilises the google books API to display a range of books based on the users search term.
A next and previous button allow the user to navigate the results of the searchers per pages of 30. Additionally, when a user clicks on one of the book cards,
a larger module is displayed providing further information around the selected book.


To add extra:
- Add scroll bars on each of the book cards and style it,
- add following padding to the search bar and buttons
  - padding: 7px 12px;
        font-size: 1.2rem;
        border-radius: 3px;
